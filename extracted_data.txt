Practical Comfort and Non-Slip Design.
Reviewed in India on 9 October 2024
Size: 7 UK
Colour: Black-Blue
Verified Purchase
I recently got the DOCTOR EXTRA SOFT Doctor Ortho Slippers for Women for ₹373. The fit is good, and they feel comfortable to wear. The cushioning provides decent support, making them suitable for regular use.
One notable aspect is that they are not slippery, which is a plus for safety, particularly on smooth surfaces. The design looks nice as well, adding a bit of style to a basic slipper.
In terms of dirtiness, the material is generally easy to clean and resists accumulating dirt, though regular cleaning is recommended, especially if worn outdoors. As for durability, they are made from quality materials and show no signs of wear after initial use, suggesting they can withstand daily wear without losing shape or comfort. Lastly, the noise level is quiet when walking, with no squeaking or unwanted sounds, making them suitable for indoor use.
Overall, they seem to be a solid choice for the price, offering comfort and practicality without any major complaints so far.

Inner material is soft but sole is too hard which make the slippers overall hard. Good for regular use but not good for medical care
